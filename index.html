                <p>Born in 1994 in Stratford, Ontario, Canada, to a single mother, Justin Bieber took second place in a local talent competition at a young age and later turned into a YouTube phenomenon. He signed a record contract with Usher and became the first solo artist to have four singles enter the Top 40 before the release of a debut album. His album My World has gone platinum in several countries, though he later experienced a ton of media exposure resulting from offensive activity. He nonetheless made his comeback in 2015 with his first No. 1 song, "What Do You Mean?"</p>

                <h4>by Chance The Rapper (ft. Saba)</h4>
                <p>Coming on the scene with vibrant rhymes and jazzy, retro beats, Chicago's Chance the Rapper broke through with the 2013 mixtape Acid Rap. Having considered a career in music throughout his high-school years, Chancelor Bennett aka Chance the Rapper used a ten-day suspension during his senior year to record his debut mixtape, 10 Day. Uploaded immediately to the Internet in 2012, the mixtape would grab the attention of Forbes magazine, which featured it in the publication's Cheap Tunes column, and Childish Gambino, who would ask Chance to join his 2012 tour of America as opening act. Gambino would land on the Acid Rap mixtape along with Ab-Soul and Action Bronson. With nothing but mixtapes in his discography, Chance was still popular enough to be a featured artist at Lollapalooza 2013. In 2016 he dropped the surprise mixtape Coloring Book, which debuted at number eight on the Billboard 200 album chart. The mixtape featured guest appearances from Kanye West, Justin Bieber, and Future.</p>

                <p>Ariana Grande was born in Boca Raton, Florida, in 1993 and began performing onstage when she as a child. A role in a Broadway play at age 15, followed by some small TV roles, helped her land the role of Cat on TV's Victorious. She followed that with the spinoff Sam & Cat and then dove headfirst into a chart-topping musical career, releasing three albums Yours Truly (2013), My Everything (2014) and Dangerous Woman (2016). Her popularity has been fueled by a strong social media presence on Instagram, Twitter and Facebook.</p>

                <h4>by Kehlani</h4>
                <p>Contemporary R&B singer and songwriter Kehlani studied ballet and modern dance at the Oakland School for the Arts. An injury prompted a move to OSA's music department, where she blossomed as a vocalist. During eighth grade, she joined Poplyfe, a band that competed on America's Got Talent during the program's sixth season. Following an affable performance of Travie McCoy's "Billionaire," judge Piers Morgan noted that he thought Kehlani, the frontperson, could be successful without the band. While Kehlani brushed the notion aside, she eventually went solo and presented herself as a slightly younger, more down-to-earth alternative to contemporary R&B artists like Jhené Aiko. Her first release, the eight-track Cloud19, was released in 2014, and a pair of its songs registered on Billboard's Twitter Emerging Artists chart. A lengthier set, You Should Be Here, followed in 2015 with guest appearances from BJ the Chicago Kid and Chance the Rapper. Shortly after its release, major label Atlantic announced that it had signed Kehlani to a recording contract.</p>

                <h4>by Desiigner</h4>
                <p>Bringing the strange, mumbly style of the Atlanta school up the East Coast, Brooklyn-based MC Desiigner landed a recording contract with Kanye West's GOOD Music imprint in 2016. Sounding like a murky mix of Future and Young Thug, the rapper made his debut in 2014 under the name Dezolo, joining MCs Phresh and Rowdy on the single "Danny Devito." Late the next year, he made his debut as Desiigner on the single "Panda." Kanye West heard the cut, and sampled it for his album The Life of Pablo. He also signed the original song's MC to his label, and re-released the track as a GOOD Music single in early 2016. By April, it had climbed all the way to number one in the U.S.; then in June it landed on his debut mixtape, New English.</p>

                <h4>by Charlie Puth (ft. Selena Gomez)</h4>
                <p>Charles Otto "Charlie" Puth, Jr. (/puːθ/; born December 2, 1991) is an American singer, songwriter and record producer who gained his initial recognition by the viral success of his song posts to YouTube.

                <p>The alias of electronic musician and producer Harley Edward Streten, Flume makes atmospheric dance music inspired by house and U.K. garage. Born in Australia, Streten began producing his own music in his early teens. Several years later, he won a competition held by Future Classic and subsequently signed with the label to release a 2011 EP featuring the track "Sleepless." The following year, he delivered his debut self-titled solo album, which featured guest appearances from Chet Faker, Jezzabell Doran, and Moon Holiday, among others. In his homeland, it topped the ARIA album chart and went double platinum; in the U.S., it was issued on the Mom + Pop label. A deluxe edition of the debut followed in November of 2013 with cred-enhancing contributions from Ghostface Killah, Boldy James, M.O.P., and Killer Mike. The same month, he released his and Faker's collaborative Lockjaw EP, and he toured the U.S. with Disclosure.</p>

                <h4>by Alessia Cara</h4>
                <p>Canadian pop-R&B singer and songwriter Alessia Cara (full last name: Caracciolo) made her recorded debut in 2015, though she started racking up YouTube views -- with acoustic covers of popular songs across several genres -- four years earlier. Upon graduating from high school in her native Brampton, a suburb of Toronto, Ontario, Cara opted to devote a year to music rather than go straight to college. She continued to upload YouTube clips regularly and landed a major-label recording contract with Def Jam. Matched up with Andrew "Pop" Wansel, Warren "Oak" Felder, and Coleridge Tillman, a trio of songwriters and producers with dozens of R&B and pop hits between them, Cara co-wrote and recorded the distinctive wallflower anthem "Here" and had the song released as a single in May 2015.</p>

Two years later, his mixtape The Endless Summer landed with that hit redo of Dion's "Runaround Sue." In 2012, he released his second LP, Must Be Nice, hitting the road with Hoodie Allen and joining the Van's Warped Tour. In 2014, he returned with his first major-label release, These Things Happen (RCA Records). As his popularity grew in the following year, he embarked on an extensive international tour and recorded his fourth album. When It's Dark Out was released in late 2015 and included the hit duet with Bebe Rexha, "Me, Myself & I." In the summer of 2016, while on tour with Logic, YG, and Yo Gotti, Eazy appeared on Britney Spears' comeback single "Make Me."</p>
